Beam::Wire configuration library](http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire).

## Abstract

It's common for an application to load data from a configuration file,
and it's common to want your users to plug-in custom features to your
application. Instead of writing your own configuration handling,
[Beam::Wire](http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire) gives you a flexible
and robust system out-of-the-box. Using a simple YAML file, your users
can easily configure your application and their plugins (however simple
or complex) without making it difficult for you. Beam::Wire can even
make it easy for your users to replace large parts of your application
with their own components for maximum flexibility!

## Covered Topics

This talk covers:

* Basic usage of [Beam::Wire](http://metacpan.org/pod/Beam::Wire)
* Dependency injection
* Use of [Moo](http://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) and
  [Type::Tiny](http://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny) to ease configuration
